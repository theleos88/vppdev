	## Set logical CPU core where main thread runs

	## Sets number of CPU core(s) to be skipped (1 ... N-1)
	## Skipped CPU core(s) are not used for pinning main thread and working thread(s).
	## The main thread is automatically pinned to the first available CPU core and worker(s)
	## are pinned to next free CPU core(s) after core assigned to main thread
	# skip-cores 4

	## Specify a number of workers to be created
	## Workers are pinned to N consecutive CPU cores while skipping "skip-cores" CPU core(s)
	## and main thread's CPU core
	# workers 2

	## Set scheduling policy and priority of main and worker threads

	## Scheduling policy options are: other (SCHED_OTHER), batch (SCHED_BATCH)
	## idle (SCHED_IDLE), fifo (SCHED_FIFO), rr (SCHED_RR)
	# scheduler-policy fifo

	## Scheduling priority is used only for "real-time policies (fifo and rr),
	## and has to be in the range of priorities supported for a particular policy
	# scheduler-priority 50
